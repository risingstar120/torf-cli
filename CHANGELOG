  - Support for default arguments and special profiles in ~/.config/torf/config
    or any file specified by --config or -f.
  - Use \e[0E instead of \e[1` to clear the line when showing progress.
    (marcelpaulo)
  - If output is not a TTY, "Progress ..." lines are not cleared but followed by
    a newline character and the rest of the line is parsable like the other
    output.
  - Long or multiline torrent file comments are now properly indented.
  - --exclude patterns are now matched against each directory/file name in a
    path instead of just the file name.
  - Torrent file and magnet link are now both created by default, and the
    --magnet option was replaced by --nomagnet and --notorrent.
  - In the output 'Magnet URI' was shortened to 'Magnet', 'Torrent File' was
    shortened to 'Torrent' and 'Creation Date' was shortened to 'Created'.
  - The default for --date was changed from 'today' to 'now'.


2018-04-08 1.1
  - Major rewrite with lots of tests that should fix the most obvious bugs
  - The options --source and --nosource have been removed
  - The option --nocreator has been added
  - Output is now easier to parse when stdout is not a TTY (e.g. when piping to
    grep, cut, awk, etc)
