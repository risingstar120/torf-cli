  - Support for default arguments and special profiles in ~/.config/torf/config
    or any file specified by --config or -f.
  - Use \e[0E instead of \e[1` to clear the line when showing progress.
    (marcelpaulo)
  - If output is not a TTY, "Progress ..." lines are not cleared but followed by
    a newline character and the rest of the line is parsable like the other
    output.
  - Long or multiline comments are now properly indented.
  - --exclude patterns are now matched against each directory or the file name
    in each file path


2018-04-08 1.1
  - Major rewrite with lots of tests that should fix the most obvious bugs
  - The options --source and --nosource have been removed
  - The option --nocreator has been added
  - Output is now easier to parse when stdout is not a TTY (e.g. when piping to
    grep, cut, awk, etc)
