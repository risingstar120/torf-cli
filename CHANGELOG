2019-??-?? 3.1.0
  - Huge performance increase due to multithreading.
  - Verify a torrent's content: torf -i content.torrent path/to/content
  - Progress is now reported in two lines with more information.
  - New option: --verbose shows file sizes in plain bytes, and verifies file
    content more thoroughly.
  - Support for multiple tiers of announce URLs when creating torrents.
  - Exit codes have changed and are now properly documented in the man page.
  - Fix --max-piece-size to allow piece sizes larger than 16 MiB.


2019-06-03 3.0.1
  - Fixed minor bug that caused trailing zeros to be removed from numbers, e.g.
    "10 GiB" was displayed as "1 GiB"


2019-04-04 3.0.0
  - Use proper version number scheme.
  - Fixed "--exclude requires PATH" error when editing a torrent with global
    "exclude" options in the config file.
  - New options: --source to add a "source" field to the torrent and --nosource
    to remove it from an existing torrent.
  - New option: --max-piece-size optionally limits the piece size.


2018-06-19 2.0
  - Support for default arguments and special profiles in ~/.config/torf/config
    or any file specified by --config or -f.
  - Use \e[0E instead of \e[1` to clear the line when showing progress.
    (marcelpaulo)
  - If output is not a TTY, "Progress ..." lines are not cleared but followed by
    a newline character and the rest of the line is parsable like the other
    output.
  - Long or multiline torrent file comments are now properly indented.
  - --exclude patterns are now matched against each directory/file name in a
    path instead of just the file name.
  - Torrent file and magnet link are now both created by default, and the
    --magnet option was replaced by --nomagnet and --notorrent.
  - In the output 'Magnet URI' was shortened to 'Magnet', 'Torrent File' was
    shortened to 'Torrent' and 'Creation Date' was shortened to 'Created'.
  - The default for --date was changed from 'today' to 'now'.


2018-04-08 1.1
  - Major rewrite with lots of tests that should fix the most obvious bugs
  - The options --source and --nosource have been removed
  - The option --nocreator has been added
  - Output is now easier to parse when stdout is not a TTY (e.g. when piping to
    grep, cut, awk, etc)
